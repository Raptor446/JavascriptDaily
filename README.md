Daily JavaScript Solved Questions üöÄ
This repository is my daily log of JavaScript coding challenges. My goal is to consistently practice and improve my skills by solving one problem every day. Each folder is named by date and contains the problem description and my solution.

Structure üìÅ
2025-09-05 folder: Each day's solution is in its own folder (e.g., 2025-09-18).

README.md: This file inside each folder explains the problem, the solution, and any key concepts I learned.

solution.js: This file contains the actual code.
